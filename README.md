# Data_Forge-
Processing and refining big data

First we have to think about how we can see them
In these files I want to sort the information and put it in excel but use a python script so that I can sort the data
And to make a new excel with the new information and we can easily compress it after 


Read.py

Now that we've read them we need to think about how we can read them better to know what we are dealing with 
Convert.py

After that we need to think about how we can process that data to get the desired result and group duplicates

With Rezolvare.py we precess the data and put them in separate excel spreadsheets separating the duplicate values from the unique ones and we also make a graph with this weight to see better, anyway I am aware that there is room for improvement for my projects so far 

May your dreams come true :)))
